		<h3> Me Myself and I</h3>
		<p>I am the <strong><i>most amazing person</i></strong> you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting, according to me. 
			I'm a Junior here at eastern and my hobbies include reading syfy, watching anime/KDrama/ Murder investigation shows,
			 painting galaxy girls, and sleeping my life away. I'm may be a bit green behind the ears when it comes to Computer 
			 Science but I do try my hardest. Now for some <strong>Samuel L Jackson</strong> ipsum filler; <br  /;>
			 <em> 
			 	"You think water moves fast? 
				 You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. 
				 After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, 
				 but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only <strong>five</strong> made it out. Now we took an oath, 
				 that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. 
				 Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to <strong><i>man</i></strong>..."
